# AR.IO Tools

A collection of tools designed to work with the AR.IO SDK and the Arweave network. These tools make it easier to interact with the Arweave Name System (ArNS), process Arweave Name Tokens (ANTs), fetch Gateway details, and convert JSON data to CSV for easier analysis.

This repository includes:

1. **ArNS Details Fetcher**: A script to fetch and save details about Arweave Name System (ArNS) names.
2. **Gateway Details Fetcher**: A script to fetch and save details about AR.IO Gateways.
3. **JSON-to-CSV Converter**: A simple utility to convert JSON files to CSV format.

## Tool: ArNS Details Fetcher

### Description

The ArNS Details Fetcher script retrieves data about registered ArNS names, including:

  - Owner address
  - @ transaction ID
  - Timestamps and duration
  - Purchase details
- Save results to a timestamped JSON file in the `output` directory
- Handle network timeouts and errors gracefully

### Usage: ArNS Details Fetcher

Run the script:
```bash
npm start
```

The script will:
- Fetch the 10 most recent ArNS records

npm run gateway-details
```

The script will:
1. Prompt you to choose output type:
   ```plaintext
   Do you want FULL DETAILS or SUMMARY? (F/S):
   ```
2. Fetch all gateway records
3. Process according to your choice
4. Save results to a timestamped JSON file in the `output` directory

---

### Usage: JSON-to-CSV Converter

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   npm run json-to-csv
   ```

2. Follow the prompts:
   - **Input JSON File**: Enter the path to your JSON file
   - **Output CSV File**: Enter the name of the output file or press Enter to use the default name

   Example prompts:
   ```plaintext
   Enter the path to the input JSON file: ./example.json
   Enter the name of the output CSV file (default: example.csv): custom-output.csv
   ```

3. The output CSV file will be saved in the `output` directory.
